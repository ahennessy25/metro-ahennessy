"0","#This reveals a latitude/longitude map of the stations. They are each color coded by the color each of these lines are assigned to in real life. U1 is red, U2 is purple, U3 is orange, U4 is green and U6 is brown. The stations where the subway lines intersect are color coded in white and are called ""Intersection"" subway stations.  "
